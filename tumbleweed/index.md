## Choosing which Media to Download

The DVD/USB Stick is typically recommended as it contains most of the packages available in the distribution and does not require a network connection during the installation.

The Network CD/USB Stick is recommended for users who have limited bandwidth on their internet connections, as it will only download the packages they choose to install, which is likely to be significantly less than 4.7GB.

## Unsupported LiveCDs
openSUSE Tumbleweed also offers a number of unsupported LiveCDs. These cannot be used for Installation or Upgrade. They are not an accurate reflection as to whether or not Tumbleweed will run on your hardware. [Get Unsupported Tumbleweed LiveCDs.]({{ site.url }}/tumbleweed/unsupported)

## Verify your download before use

Many applications can verify the checksum of a download. To verify your download can be important as it verifies you really have got the ISO file you wanted to download and not some broken version. You could verify the file in the process of downloading. For example a checksum (SHA256) will be used automatically if you choose Metalink in the field above and use the add-on DownThemAll! in Firefox.

For each ISO, we offer a checksum file with the corresponding SHA256 sum. 

For extra security, you can use GPG to verify who signed those .sha256 files. It should be 22C0 7BA5 3417 8CD0 2EFE 22AA B88B 2FD4 3DBD C284.
